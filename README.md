# Shortest Path Models, 2021

Since these projects are used by Cornell University as curriculum in the Introduction to Operations Reaserch course I cannot upload the source code.

However, the highlights of this project are as follows:
- Application of Djikstra's algorithm to minimize the variance of line lengths in a text file with a model that takes the user through each iteration of the algorithm with the corresponding output

- and a model that allows the user to change the desired line length and the objective function to use

- Application of Djikstra's algorithm to minimize the cost of maintaining an inventory of pipes with a toy example of how a small inventory can be modeled with a graph and how deciding what pipes ot store corresponds to paths in the graph

- and a full scale example with randomized demands that allows users to visualize the importance of Djikstra's algorithm for larger examples
